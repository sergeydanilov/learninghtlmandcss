<h1 class="blue">An introduction to elements, tags and contents</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Elements</strong> consist of <strong>content</strong> bookended by a
    <em>start</em> tag and an <em>end</em> tag.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
    Certain elements, such as the horizontal rule element, do not need content however
    and consist of a
    single, self-closing element. These are known as empty elements.
</p>
<p>
    To <strong>emphasize</strong> is to give extra weight to (a communication); <em>"Her
    gesture emphasized her words"</em>.
